# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
- We will have a weekly mandatory meeting at 9:30pm ~ 10:30pm Wednesday; we will additionally meet at other flexible times when needed.
- We will meet either on zoom or in person depending on our availability


2. **Assistance** 
- We will communicate through instagram if we need help or opinion on a task.
- Teammates should responding within couple hours for effective communication.


3. **Respect** 

- We will ensure that every member has an opportunity to speak through active encouragement and verbose communication inwhich we keep asking questions to others about the topic.
- We will never use offensive words and promote friendly interactions.


## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
- Equally divide workload and distribute amongst teammates.
- If there are any unexpected complications, we will make time to cover for one another.
- Any unexcused conflicts / absenses will be discussed thoroughly.
- Since we don't yet know what each of us are particularly good at in terms of coding, we will take the first few meetings to discuss and see how each person can contribute their best work.


5. **Time Commitment** 

- We will work throughout the week individually (around 2-3 hours) and meet on Wednesdays to check up on each other’s progress. 
- We will also attempt to resolve issues each of us had and plan out each person’s tasks for the next week. Wednesday meetings will go for an hour or two.
- If our current schedule seems to not work, we will decide collectively to work out a better time schedule.


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
- Democratic voting system - when we have a disagreement between members we will try to discuss effectively the pros and cons of what each member is thinking and vote altogether the best way of resolving the conflict. We will be honest about the progress and contributions of each member and when we collectively feel that one or more members are habitually late or not contributing enough we will discuss the causes of the issue and look for a solution that puts that member back up to pace. We will try our best to fix our internal conflicts by ourselves, but if the problem persists, we will contact the course staff.
