## 11/4/2022 (week 1)

Finished project proposal. Getting started and distributing work for upcoming week.

## 11/5-11/2022 (week 2)

This week we set up the basic structure of the project repository. We followed the same structure as one of the example github repos provided by the course. We added our combined twitter social circles dataset in our data directory. We also took our documents from prairielearn and transfered them to this repository, keeping the feedback from our project mentor in a separate directory.

Taking into account the feedback our project mentor sent us, we also reworked and edited the project proposal in preparation for the project proposal regrade on the 18th. Our goal for next week is to populate our data structure (graph represented by adjacency list) so that we can start implementing algorithms on the dataset.

## 11/12-18/2022 (week 3)

This week we rewrote our project proposal again with a new dataset so that we could implement our algorithm with a weighted graph. We updated a bit of code in the repository as well as the other information in the repo to match our new project proposal, including adding the new dataset in the data directory. Our goal for next week is to implement and populate the adjacency matrix (no longer adjacency list) so we can start implementing algorithms on our dataset.
