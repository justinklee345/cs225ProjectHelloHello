## Feedback from course staff:
Excellent work on the proposal team! That is a very well written proposal and very nice idea. I am excited to see the results as well. You can start the implementation. All the best!

## One minor thing:
Dijkstra's complexity is O(V^2) or O(ELogV) depending on whether or not you use heaps. It can never be O(V+E).
