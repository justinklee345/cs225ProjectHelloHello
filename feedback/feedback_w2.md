## Feedback from course staff:
Good job on the proposal. But after an internal team discussion, we have concluded that we are not allowing Dijkstra on unweighted graphs as that does not make much sense. Please choose another algorithm that fits, re-submit the new proposal, and email me once you do so I can regrade it. Also, mention how you plan to check the “six handshakes” rule using the proposed algorithms.
